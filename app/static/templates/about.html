          <h3>Max Marian</h3>
          <p>Max Marian is Assistant Professor for Multiscale Engineering Mechanics at the Department of Mechanical and Metallurgical Engineering and the School of Engineering at Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile. His research focuses on energy efficiency and sustainability through tribology with an emphasis on the modification of surfaces through micro-texturing and coatings (diamond-like carbon, molybdenum disulfide, MXenes). Besides machine elements and engine components, he expanded his fields towards biotribology and artificial joints. His research is particularly related to the development of numerical multiscale tribo-simulation and machine learning approaches. He has published more than 30 peer-reviewed journal publications and is in the Editorial Boards from Frontiers in Chemistry Nanoscience as well as Industrial Lubrication and Tribology (ILT). Furthermore, he is a member of the Society of Tribologists and Lubrication Engineers (STLE) and the German Society for Tribology (GfT).</p>
