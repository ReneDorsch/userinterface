As verified by SEM (TestMethod) and Raman (TestMethod) spectroscopy (TestMethod), this was due to the insitu formation of a tribo-film on the disks (Geometry) consisting of densified Ti3C2Tx (CompositeElement)-nanosheets, which was particularly pronounced for the lower initial Hertzian pressure (InputAttribute) of 0.8 (OperationalParameter) giga Pascal (OperationalParameter).
